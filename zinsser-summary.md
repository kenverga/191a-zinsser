# Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by Kathleen Enverga

In chapter 2, Zinsser focuses on how American writing is cluttered and complex. The principles of good writing can only be learned through clearing the mind of fluff and focusing on words that matter. The major trick is to keep everything simple. In chapter 3, Zinsser defines and gives examples of ‘clutter.’ He sees clutter as controllable yet inevitable thing that plays a destructive role in writing. Clutter can be used to hide mistakes or to amplify one’s intelligence in writing but its effects are the opposite of those. If there is a way to simplify something, do it.
